# space social

social media for the galaxy-wide-web! ðŸŒŒ

this is a neat experiment in building as much of a fediverse-compatible
software stack as i can (at least before the crippling weight of the full
activitypub spec finally cripples me)

starting, of course, with a nice frontend! âœ¨

should you choose to play around with this yourself, just know that *many
things are bound not to work!* notably, this has only been tested on iceshrimp
and mastodon API-compliant instances. anything beyond this will likely be
incompatible, and the web console will get very upset.

## features

### current

- infinite-scrolling feed
- log in with most/all fedi services! (with varying compatibility)
- ability to favourite, boost, and react to posts
- view threads in context
- fun, clicky buttons!

### planned

- posting! (incl. replies and quotes)
- live feed
- notifications feed

### "maybe"

- fast account switching
- post editing/deletion
- push notifications

## try it out!

- `git clone` this repo
- `npm install` the dependencies
- `npm run dev` to spin up the dev environment
- have fun! âœ¨
